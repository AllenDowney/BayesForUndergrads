## Preliminary questions

### Who are your students?

1. Why do they want to take your class?
2. What do they know coming in?
3. Are there prerequisites?
4. What levels of programming skill do you expect?
5. What levels of mathematical comfort and capability do you expect?
6. What happens after your class, later in the curriculum?  After graduation?

Let's identify some axes and see if there are natural clusters.


### What are your goals for the class?

1. What knowledge should they acquire?  (And how will you know?)
2. What skills will they develop?
3. What attitudes do you want to foster or discourage?
4. What kinds of problems should they be able to solve?

## Course design

### Inventory of Bayesian methods

1. Applying Bayes's theorem with paper and pencil
1. Table method for applying Bayes's theorem
1. Odds form of Bayes's theorem
1. Log-odds form of Bayes's theorem
1. Analysis by integration: 1-dimensional hypothesis spaces
1. Analysis by integration: 2-dimensional hypothesis spaces
1. Analysis using conjugate distributions (beta, Dirchlet, ...)
1. Analysis by approximation (e.g., normal and Poisson approximations)
1. Computation using spreadsheets
1. Computation using discrete distributions and grid methods
1. Computation using MCMC


### Inventory of Bayesian applications

1. Estimating counts: dice problem, German-tank problem, tag and recapture, Lincoln index.
2. Estimating proportions: cookie problem, Euro problem, polling.
3. Estimating rates: World Cup problem, Boston Bruins, Red Line problem.
4. Tracking, filtering, sensor integration (e.g. lighthouse problem).
5. Medical testing: sickle-cell anemia, Marfan's syndrome, PKU testing
6. Courtroom arguments (Bayes and the law)
7. Monty Hall and its variants
8. Testing for ESP
9. Product reliability (sequential sampling)
10. Is it my phone number?

### Exercise  

Based on the methods and applications we have seen so far, outline a
class that would be appropriate for your students and your setting.
We'll suggest a grid that might help with this planning.

At this point you might only be able to plan the beginning of your
class, and of course you are likely to revise it as you collect more
resources.
