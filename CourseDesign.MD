## Preliminary questions

### Who are your students?

1. Why do they want to take your class?
2. What do they know coming in?
3. Are there prerequisites?
4. What levels of programming skill do you expect?
5. What levels of mathematical comfort and capability do you expect?
6. What happens after your class, later in the curriculum?  After graduation?

Let's identify some axes and see if there are natural clusters.


### What are your goals for the class?

1. What knowledge should they acquire?  (And how will you know?)
2. What skills will they develop?
3. What attitudes do you want to foster or discourage?

## Course design

### Inventory of methods

1. Applying Bayes's theorem with paper and pencil.
2. The table method.
3. Analysis by integration.
4. Analysis using conjugate distributions.
5. Computation using spreadsheets.
6. Computation using discrete distributions and grid methods.
7. Computation using MCMC.


### Inventory of applications

1. Estimating counts: dice problem, German tank problem, tag and recapture, Lincoln index.
2. Estimating proportions: cookie problem, Euro problem.
3. Estimating rates: World Cup problem, Boston Bruins, Red Line problem.
4. Tracking, filtering, sensor integration.


### Exercise  

Based on the methods and applications we have seen so far, outline a class that
would be appropriate for your students and your setting.  We'll suggest a grid that might
help with this planning.

At this point you might only be able to plan the beginning of your class, and of course
you are likely to revise it as you collect more resources.
